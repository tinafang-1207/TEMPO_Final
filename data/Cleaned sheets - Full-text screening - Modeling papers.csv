However, this effect was only detectable as an interaction with effort in both herring models and the haddock catch model, indicating that the reduction in small-fish susceptibility and catch is only detectable in high-effort years.

No effect was detected for saithe.","RTCs work for some species, and it seems that it depends a lot on their biological and ecological characteristics. ""We can only speculate why certain species exhibit effects of the RTC system while others do not. There are a variety of potential biological mechanisms that can lead to differences in how effective an RTC system may be in reducing mortality. How aggregated a species age class is, or whether it schools, can cause a species age class to be more or less susceptible to fishing gear, and therefore how sensitive selectivity patterns are to slightly different fishing practices. Similarly, if a species is more likely to mix with other species or age classes, the probability of initiating triggers may differ among species, and their effectiveness may be reduced.""",

If we assume constant catch and constant fishing efficiency, the decrease in bycatch was 20% on average. With constant catch but reduced fishing efficiency, bycatch was reduced by only 10%. Bycatch reduction was much higher (‚àº28% on average) if the centroid closure was allowed to be dynamic in both space and time (i.e., moves from year to year). Mosaic designs were more effective than centroid designs in reducing bycatch (50% compared to 22% on average for all scenarios; SI Appendix, Table S2), and dynamic management, in which those areas can move year to year (Fig. 2), was more effective than static management approaches (48% compared to 29% on average for all scenarios","Temporal closure scenarios were generally less effective for bycatch mitigation than spatial closures, though they still had efficacy under certain conditions.

Surprisingly, protecting wider areas, through rotating closures or wide NTAs for the cell structure population model led to dramatic negative effects on overall stock size. Restocking was efficient only when a very large number of giant clams were reintroduced.
